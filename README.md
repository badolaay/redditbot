# redditbot
A reddit bot to get a digest of subreddits of your choice

Just PM your email and subreddits with ';' as delimiter to [badolaay](https://www.reddit.com/user/badolaay/)

For example: abc@mail.com;programming;jokes

This will send a digest of top posts (sorted by hot) of subreddits programming and jokes (in that order) to abc@email.com

It will also send a digest of a random subreddit

As of now each email has to be manually authorized.


### TODO

- [ ] Remove manual user email authorization
- [ ] Deploy on AWS
- [ ] Allow user to get the posts by time (day/week etc.)
- [ ] Sort the comments by user preference
